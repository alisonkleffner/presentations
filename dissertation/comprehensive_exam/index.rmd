# Importance of Arctic Sea Ice Crack Detection

+ Sea ice is a barrier between the atmosphere and the ocean
+ Cracks, or leads, may form in the ice pack due to dynamic processes
  - Allows for heat from the ocean to be transferred to the atmosphere `r Citep(bib[[c("schreyer_elastic_2006")]])`. 
  - Accounts for half of the heat flux between the ocean and atmosphere `r Citep(bib[[c("badgley_1961")]])`
+ Previous ice crack detection methods can generally be split into two categories: thermal and deformation. 
  

.center[
```{r ice-pic,  results='asis', echo = F, include = T, cache = T, eval = TRUE}


i1 <- img_modal(src = "images/Ice Chunk.png", alt = " Artice Sea Ice with Crack", other=list(width="40%"))

c(str_split(i1, "\\n", simplify = T)[1:2],
  str_split(i1, "\\n", simplify = T)[3:9]

  str_split(i1, "\\n", simplify = T)[3:9]
  ) %>% paste(collapse = "\n") %>% cat()

```
]

+ Sea Ice can be tracked by NASA's RADARSTAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS), which uses synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to track the trajectory of points on an ice sheet.
+ Each grid cell vertex is assigned an identifier (id) which is used for tracking
+ Set of all trajectories: 

.center[
$\mathcal{G} = (g_1, ..., g_n)$ $\\$
where $g_{j}$ = \{ ${s_{t_{j}}: t \in \tau_j}$\}, $\tau_j \subset \left\{t=1...T\right\}$ a collection of time points where $id_j$ is observed $\\$
and ${s_{t_{j}}}$ = $(x_{t_{j}}, y_{t_{j}})$
]

+ For our study region, n = 8811, and T = 22

# Thermal Ice Crack Detection Methods

+ Surface temperature differs between a crack and the surrounding sea ice.
+ Use thermal channels of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) `r Citep(bib[[c("key_detectability_1993")]])` 
  - Heavily dependent on clear skies and has issues with thin ice
+ Methods have been proposed to reduce the impact of clouds 
  - Moderate Resolution Imagery Spectroradiometer (MODIS)  `r Citep(bib[[c("willmes_pan-arctic_2015")]])`
  - Fuzzy Cloud Artifact (FCAF) `r Citep(bib[[c("willmes_pan-arctic_2015")]])`

# Deformation Ice Crack Detection Methods

+ Deformation of a cell is determined by the motion of points `r Citep(bib[[c("peterson_evaluating_2011")]])`
    - Finds the determinant of deformation gradient to measure accumulated area changes to show persistent diverged regions. 
    - Can find the size and orientation of the crack
+ Drawbacks
  - Need complete set of space-time observations to calculate deformation
  - The error in the deformation product may be strongly underestimated `r Citep(bib[[c("bouillon_producing_2015")]])`

# Research Objectives

1. Develop a ice crack detection method
  - Using only the movement of the ice sheet
  - Cluster trajectories based on movement, where the boundaries would be possible locations of ice cracks
2. Develop a spatio-interpolation method to predict missing points along a trajectory 
  - Using the information gained from the clustering
  - Take into account nonstationarity of the data

# Other Spatio-Temporal Clustering Methods

+ Combination of geographic location with time introduces new challenges in clustering, where a cluster is now determined based on spatial and temporal similarity $\\$ $\\$
+ Similarity Measures
  - One of the components of a clustering algorithm is to determine how to measure similarity
  - Similarity measures have been developed for spatio-temporal data, but many rely on having trajectories of the same length or are sensitive to noise
+ Density-Based Clustering
  - Objects that are densely packed in a region should be grouped together in a cluster
  - Can cluster objects into any shape and number of clusters do not need to be pre-defined
  - However, since our data is based on a grid, point density will be consistent across the domain
+ Model-Based Clustering
  - Can assume a model for each cluster, where the best fitting data for the model is found in order to determine cluster membership
  - Can be difficulty in finding the assume model


(Info from `r Citep(bib["ansari_spatiotemporal_2020"])`)

class:primary

# Other Spatio-Temporal Clustering Methods

+ Nonstationary Models `r Citep(bib[[c("kim_analyzing_2005")]])`
  - Data can be partitioned and a model can be developed for each partition
  - Partitioning can be accomplished through a Voronoi Tesselation and then use a Piecewise Gaussian Process to model the nonstationary process
  - Currently these methods are only for a spatial domain 
  
  .center[
```{r voronoi,  results='asis', echo = F, include = T, cache = T, eval = TRUE}

# Bounding Box

+ A bounding box can be created around each trajectory to represent it's movement.
+ Bounding Box Features:
  - Length travel in x/y between the minimum and maximum location 
  ( $x_{max} - x_{min}$ and $y_{max} - y_{min}$)
  - Length travel in x/y between latest and earliest observation ( $x_{1} - x_{0}$ and $y_{1} - y_{0}$)
  - Angle of movement (direction)
  - Average x/y value
  - Sub-trajectories - previous time information

#Clustering with K-Means

+ Bounding Box features were used as input into K-Means clustering, which partitions n observations into k clusters.
+ K-Means Clustering `r Citep(bib[[c("steinley_kmeans_2006")]])`
  - All observations must belong to a cluster and each cluster, k, must have at least one observation
  - Iterative Procedure 
  - Minimize squared Euclidean distance between an observation and the centroid vector of a cluster
  - Centroid vector found by averaging the features of each cluster member


---
class:primary

#Clustering with K-Means

+ **Drawback**: Number of Clusters must be specified prior to clustering
  - Number of Clusters determined using the Silhouette statistic
+ Silhouette Statistic `r Citep(bib[[c("kodinariya_2013")]])`
  - Compares within cluster distances to between cluster distances
  
.center[
$s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{max(a(i), b(i))}$ $\\$
where $a(i)$ is the average distance between i and observations in same cluster and $b(i)$ is the minimum average distance between i and observations in other clusters
]

  - Number of clusters determined by largest average silhoutte width

#Other Trajectory Interpolation Methods

+ Linear interpolation 
  - Popular due to ease in implementation
  - Performs best for linearly moving objects, or can potentially work well with non-linear data if sample in high enough frequency `r Citep(bib[[c("guo_improved_2021")]])`

#Finding Spatio-Temporal Neighbors

+ Using information gained from clusters to identify spatio-temporal neighbors
  - Know how other points in the cluster move at a time point
  - Would expect a missing point  at that time to move similarly to known points
+ Cluster by Weekly trajectories to find neighbors
  - Intersection of one week's clusters with the week before and week after would create groups
  - Each member of a group is then a spatio-temporal neighbor of the other members as they are in a similar geographic region over time. 
  
---
class:primary

#Finding Spatio-Temporal Neighbors - Steps

1. Create a polygon around each cluster for a week 
  - Finding boundary coordinates of the clusters
  - Done in a sequential manner
2. After a polygon is created, all ids located in that polygon are removed.
  - Make sure all ids are found within a polygon
3. Find the intersection of the weekly polygons
  - All of the points within that intersection are spatio-temporal neighbors.

.center[
```{r int-pic,  results='asis', echo = F, include = T, cache = T, eval = TRUE}

#Gaussian Process (GP) for Spatial Data

$\left\{X(s): s \in R^2\right\}$ is a Gaussian Process where, $X(s) = (x(s_1),...,x(s_n))$

In a GP, the data are modeled as, $X(s) \sim N(\mu, \Sigma_{\theta})$

Can define $\Sigma_{\theta}$ as the Exponential Covariance Function `r Citep(bib[[c("gpgp_pkg")]])`

.center[
$\Sigma_{\theta} = \sigma^2exp(-||x-y||/\phi)$ $\\$
where $\sigma^2$ is the variance and $\phi$ is the range
]

Joint density of the observations can be written as a product of conditional densities `r Citep(bib[[c("guinness_permutation_2018")]])`
.center[
$f(x_1,...,x_n) = \prod^n_{i=2} f(x_i|x_1,...,x_{i-1})$ 

]


This can be a computationally complex process due to the inversion of $\Sigma_{\theta}$

---
class:primary

#GP for Spatial-Temporal Data

Now, the covariance function is an Exponential Space-Time `r Citep(bib[[c("gpgp_pkg")]])`

$$\Sigma_{\theta} = \sigma^2e^{-||D^{-1}(x-y)||}.$$ where 

.center[
```{r cov-pic, echo = F, include = T, cache = T, eval = TRUE, out.width="50%"}


include_graphics("images/cov_function.png")

```
$\\$
where $\sigma^2$ =  variance, $\phi$ = spatial range, $\tau$ = temporal range, $c_0$ = nugget 

]

This is a Separable covariance function, meaning it has the form: $$\Sigma_{s}\otimes\Sigma_{t}$$

Separability can speed up computations if no missing data, but we do...

#Vecchia's Approximation for a GP

+ **Goal:** To speed up calculation of a GP
+ Writes the joint density as a product of conditional distributions, where only a subset of the data is used to create the conditional distributions `r Citep(bib[[c("guinness_permutation_2018")]])`

.center[
$f(x_1,...,x_n) = \prod^n_{i=2} f(x_i|x_{n(i)})$ $\\$
where $n(i)$ are the neighbors of observation $i$
]

+ Neighbors are obtained from the order of points `r Citep(bib[[c("vecchia1988estimation")]])`

+ Vecchia's Approximation is implemented in the GpGp package, where updates to the ordering method and a grouping method were introduced to speed up calculations `r Citep(bib[[c("gpgp_pkg")]])`


---
class:primary

#Spatio-Temporal Interpolation

+ Individual model developed for both x and y using the GpGp package in R `r Citep(bib[[c("gpgp_pkg")]])`
  - Within each intersection
+ Use Exponential Space-Time covariance function (as previously defined)
+ Output is the maximum likelihood estimates for the mean and covariance parameters
+ Use model to determine estimates of missing locations
  - From the conditional expectation of the model
  - Create a grid encompassing our ice sheet to give a starting value of the missing locations. 
  - The model will then adjust this location using its known neighbors

#Simulation Study

+ Create Underlying Process Grid 
  - Simulating movement of ocean that causes observations to move
  - Initial grid was created and shifted seven times to represent seven days of movement in the underlying process.
  - This data is then used to create the covariance matrix, $C_{d,c}(\theta)$
  - Covariance parameters and defined mean trend ( $\mu_{d,c}$ ) is different for each cluster $\\$

.center[
$U_{d,c}(s,t) \sim GP(\mu_{d,c}, C_{d,c}(\theta))$ $\\$

where $U_{d,c}(s,t)$ is the displacement at location $s$ & time $t$ $\\$ for $d$ = x or y, cluster $c$

]

**Note**: Only 2 clusters for simplicity

#Simulation Study

+ Create Observed Grid
  - Movement of an observed point is determined by the value of the nearest point of the underlying process for that day ( $g$ )
  - Obtained a week's worth of simulated data

  $(x_{t,j}, y_{t,j}) = (U^{X}_{t-1,c,g}, U^{Y}_{t-1,c,g}) + (x_{t-1,j}, y_{t-1,j})$ $\\$
  where t=1,...,7 (time), j = 1,...,121 (id), $\\$ U is the underlying process value at $t-1$ for cluster ( $c$ ) and grid id ( $g$ )

# Clustering with Bounding Box

+ Advantages
  - Provides information about how the data is moving
  - Shown through simulations and the ice data to provide a reasonable estimation of the locations of cracks
+ Drawbacks
  - Relies on a pre-defined number of clusters, which generally is not known
  - Have a set number of cluster, so a limit on how many cluster boundaries, thus cracks.

#Intersection Model Interpolation

+ Advantages
  - Takes into account the nonstationarity of the data
  - Showed some improvement, in terms of RMSE, over linear interpolation for curved data that is not highly sampled
  - Able to estimate data on first and last day of a dataset, which linear interpolation is not able to do. 
  - Able to calculate uncertainty

#Comments on Model Development

+ Log-likelihood does not converge 
  - Temporal range value is exceptionally large especially in comparison to the spatial range
+ Impractical Covariance Parameter estimates - large temporal range
  - This may be due to only working with small amount of data that is not moving much over time
  - With the simulated data, as more days were added to the dataset, the temporal range does slowly decrease
+ Potentially not a lot of data in the intersection
  - Some intersections are small
  - Need variation in time

# Steps for Program Completion 
+ Modeling Arctic Sea Ice
  - Bivariate Interpolation
  - Visualization of results
  - Investigate model further (why covariance parameter estimates impractical)
+ Visualization and comparison of spatial field data
+ Explaining Machine Learning Output for Spatial Data
  - To explain what the optimal management decisions are for profitability for a farmer's field, accounting for a range of factors. 
  - Develop a user-interface which will be designed around explaining machine learning output to non-experts, 
  - Build trust in the model predictions without requiring farmers to learn the details of statistical modeling.
